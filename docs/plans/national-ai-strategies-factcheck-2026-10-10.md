# NATIONAL-AI-STRATEGIES.md: second-model review, 2026-10-10

The fact check of [`NATIONAL-AI-STRATEGIES.md`](../../NATIONAL-AI-STRATEGIES.md) by a model that did not write it,
in the pattern of [`stichting-factcheck-2026-10-08.md`](stichting-factcheck-2026-10-08.md). Committed as evidence, not
summarised. The decisions behind the note are `DECISIONS.md` #101; the working log is
[`national-ai-log.md`](national-ai-log.md).

**Produced by.** Six Claude Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`) subagents, launched from the Claude Fable 5.1 session
`https://claude.ai/code/session_01FcnUV5xYY1w5oSz7Vnzqf2` that wrote the note, one per cluster of entries plus
one for sections 2, 4 and 6. Each fetched the cited pages itself (WebFetch, with `pdftotext` or a local parse
where a PDF or spreadsheet would not read), judged every factual claim in the snapshot tables against them, and
tried to source every cell marked **[unverified]** from an official page. None edited the repository. The note's
revision checked is the one in commit `5537135`.

**Verdicts.** CONFIRMED: the fetched page supports the claim, with a quote of at most 25 words. NOT CONFIRMED: the
page is reachable and does not say it, or says otherwise. UNCLEAR: page unreachable or ambiguous. For unverified
cells, FOUND gives the page, the quote and the fact as sourced; NOT FOUND says what was tried. Quotes came through
a summarising extractor unless marked otherwise, so they are evidence of what the reviewer saw, not exact text.

## Totals

| Part | Claims checked | Confirmed | Not confirmed | Unclear | Unverified cells | Found | Not found |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Austria, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands | 151 | 140 | 3 | 8 | 39 | 17 | 22 |
| Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Romania | 256 | 227 | 11 | 18 | 47 | 14 | 33 |
| Croatia, Czechia, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia | 274 | 258 | 2 | 14 | 46 | 21 | 25 |
| Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden | 174 | 158 | 11 | 5 | 46 | 17 | 29 |
| France, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Spain | 175 | 161 | 11 | 3 | 35 | 17 | 18 |
| Sections 2, 4 and 6 (routes, EU vehicles, cross-cutting) | 56 | 43 | 12 | 1 | 9 | 6 | 3 |
| **All** | **1,086** | **987** | **50** | **49** | **222** | **92** | **130** |

Sections 2 and 6 carry no URL and no unverified mark, so they had nothing to check. Of the 50 claims not
confirmed, 19 were true on an official page the note had not cited (only the citation changed) and 31 were wrong,
overstated or unsourced in the note (the text changed).

## What was applied to the note

Every NOT CONFIRMED verdict and every FOUND cell was applied by the writing session in the commit that adds this
file, with each edit asserted to match exactly one place in the note. In short:

- **Corrected.** MeluXina-AI's accelerator count (1,008 GPUs, not over 2,100); the Dutch Caribbean languages;
  Gefion's funders (a foundation and the state's investment fund, not private); the Lithuanian factory's EU share
  (EUR 65 million, not 90); Latvia's AI Centre founders; Meltemi's announcement date; the Romanian models' training
  data (a slice of a 40-billion-token corpus, not 40 billion tokens); Cyprus's DAEDALUS access, consultation dates
  and adoption target; the EU supercomputer count by state (twelve, not eleven); OpenEuroLLM's GPU-hour awards and
  what they were for; the AI Factory access-mode timings; the AI Continent Action Plan's EUR 10 billion (a total for
  supercomputing and factories, not a commitment to factories); the "buy European" quotation; Sweden's MIMER timing;
  AMALIA's consortium; Lucie's instruct date; ORTOLANG's lead; the "provisional" flag on four Eurostat populations.
- **Removed as unsourced.** Mutual intelligibility claims (Danish, Swedish), "Finnish is a close relative" (now
  marked), "English with Ireland" (now sourced to the Irish Constitution), the Swiss antenna's attachment, Svea's
  stage-two scope, the Italian LISA inauguration date, the PLLuM demo at CLARIN-PL, the SRCE quotation's wording.
- **Filled from official pages.** Austria's 2001 minority-language census, MUSICA's opening, AI:AT's expected
  operation, Vienna's Gigafactory expression of interest; Germany's Teuken funding, SOOFI's first release, KIPITZ;
  Luxembourg's rollout count and CLARIN status; the Dutch cabinet's Gigafactory position, SoNaR and CLARIAH-NL;
  Bulgaria's Discoverer and BRAIN++ funding; Cyprus's census; Greece's Green500 and cooling; Ireland's UCCIX weights
  and eSTÓR; Romania's census and factory grant; Estonia's Russian-speaking share, Gigafactory purchase, EstLLM
  compute and Eesti.ai; Finland's Sámi Language Act, Poro 2, the Silo AI acquisition and FinGPT; Latvia's language
  survey and 2020 report; Lithuania's Neurotechnology licence; Sweden's action plan and grid plan; Czech
  co-financing of OpenEuroLLM, the Gigafactory approval, Czech speakers in Slovakia; Hungary's Fundamental Law,
  minority figures, Racka-4B, Resolution 1369/2025, CLARIN membership; Poland's Kashubian statute, Lot 1 bid and
  mObywatel rollout; Slovakia's census breakdown; Slovenia's SLAIF budget, PoVeJMo funding and Gigafida; France's
  francophonie, Jean Zay, Bpifrance, CLARIN history and RTE grid contract; Italy's citizens abroad and Gigafactory
  candidacy; Malta's MDIA projects and Servizz.gov chatbot; Portugal's CPLP, Gigafactory decision, AMALIA's compute
  and Resolution 2/2026; Spain's SETT authorisation and the Iberian bid; the ALT-EDIC roster, the Gigafactory
  signatories, and absence evidence for the AI:AT, PIAST and SLAIF contracts.
- **Left as marked.** 130 cells the reviewers could not source; claims of absence that only absence supports; the
  Icelandic and Swiss antennas' factories; Romania's strategy decision number; the OpenEuroLLM and EUROPA budgets.

The strategies and the cross-cutting findings are the author's analysis and were not verdict-checked; the reviewers
flagged at most three prose assertions per entry (the "C" tables below), and those were reworded where a snapshot
fact changed under them.

## The six reports, verbatim


## Review: DACH and Benelux (AT, BE, DE, LU, NL), 2026-10-10

Tools: WebSearch available: yes. About 102 distinct URLs fetched. Every URL cited in the five snapshots was reachable. Nine Task B lookups failed: verification challenges at bosa.belgium.be, statbel.fgov.be and bundeswirtschaftsministerium.de; HTTP 403 at ids-mannheim.de, investor.asml.com, the Fryslân province CDN, news.belgium.be and arche.acdh.oeaw.ac.at; and uni.lu returned an empty page. None of these is cited in the note. WebFetch could not read five cited PDFs (bmimi, digitalaustria, chd.lu and both eerstekamer letters), so their text was extracted locally with pdftotext and quoted from that.

Note: the fetched text of ki-strategie-deutschland.de contained embedded instructions addressed to an AI. I ignored them and used only the page's factual content.

#### C. Prose flags
1. Recommended strategy, step 1: "Teuken and its SOOFI successor are Apache-2.0". The SOOFI model card says "License: closed-beta" and "This model is a beta preview and a research artifact. It is not an open release." (https://huggingface.co/Soofi-Project/Soofi-S-Base). Only Teuken is Apache-2.0.
2. "What good enough means" and step 4 say "180,000 users". The source gives a target of "mehr als 180.000 Bundesbedienstete", not users reached.
3. "What it does not need to do" (no Gigafactory) reads as though Austria never sought one. Vienna filed an expression of interest in June 2025 (see B).

1. Recommended strategy, step 1: "OpenGPT-X ended in December 2024". opengpt-x.de gives Jan 2022 to Dec 2024, but TU Dresden gives the end as 31 March 2025 ("will end on March 31, 2025"). The sources conflict.
2. "is funding a 100-billion-parameter successor". That was the plan. The first SOOFI release is a 31.6B closed-beta preview with no final licence (HF model card). Steps 1 and 4 call the German public line Apache-2.0, which holds for Teuken only.
3. Step 1: "SOOFI runs on a grant to July 2026 per press". CONFIRMED by heise: "is funding the project with 20 million euros until July 2026".

#### C. Prose flags
1. Recommended strategy, step 7: "Decide the Gigafactory on the grid … Eneco and Volt ask for a pre-purchase". The cabinet already decided on 31 March 2026 that the budget has no room for the commitment, and prefers market-financed Gigafactories (Kamerstuk 26643 nr. 1499). The blocker's "if the government pre-purchases Gigafactory compute" should reflect this decision.
2. "What good enough means": "with Frisian and the Caribbean municipalities' languages where the law provides". This relies on the NOT CONFIRMED claim that Papiamentu and English are official in the Caribbean municipalities.
3. Step 5: "serves 25 million Dutch speakers". The figure is not in any cited source.

## Review: Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Cyprus and Ireland (BG, CY, EL, IE, RO), 2026-10-10
Tools: WebSearch available yes (about 30 queries); about 104 distinct URLs fetched; 16 failed (403: irishstatutebook.ie, 4 gov.ie pages, gov.cy census page, fra.europa.eu, digital-skills-jobs.europa.eu; 404: parapolitika.gr article, hpcf.cyi.ac.cy/cyclone.html; hang-up: legislatie.just.ro; redirect to home page: pio.gov.cy, dfa.ie; empty or unreadable: parliament.bg (en and bg), constcourt.bg PDF). Each failure was retried once at most. Two xlsx files (NSI and the Romanian census) and one PDF (CYSTAT) were parsed locally, because WebFetch could not read them.

Method notes: a verdict applies to the URL(s) cited in that row. When a fact sits on a different page from the one cited, the verdict is NOT CONFIRMED for the cited page, and the page that does carry the fact is named.

1. Recommended strategy point 1: "OpenLLM-Ro has shown continued pretraining on 40 billion Romanian tokens" repeats the NOT CONFIRMED snapshot claim. The report trains on fractions of a 40B-token corpus.
2. "a Gigafactory bid": the official page shows an expression of interest to pre-select a consortium leader, not a submitted EuroHPC bid. A 2025 press item calls the June 2025 letter of intent a bid. The snapshot words this carefully; the prose is looser.

2. Step 4 assumes that no public AI service exists yet. The press report of a gov.hr AI assistant (June 2026, see B) needs reconciling.

1. Recommended strategy step 5: "Moldova's antenna is attached to PIAST". CONFIRMED: FAIMA (Moldova) is linked to the PIAST AI Factory (https://www.eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/ai-factory-antennas_en). The EuroHPC ai-factories overview lists no antenna under PIAST, so the two EuroHPC pages differ.
2. Step 6: "The Baltic bid, now in the EuroHPC call". The government page describes a Polish Lot 1 bid, and press reports Estonia and Latvia withdrew, so calling it "the Baltic bid" may be out of date.

1. "Svea's second stage already fine-tunes open models": not what the page says (see A).
2. "the strategy's action plan could not be confirmed" (main blocker): the action plan exists on the strategy page (B above). Its funding of Svea was not checked.
3. "the factory's system from 2027": confirmed by sweden_en.

#### NOT CONFIRMED
1. DK, Language shared with: "mutually intelligible with Norwegian and Swedish". The cited HF cards do not say this.
2. DK, Models: Gefion "privately funded". SDU says it is funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation and EIFO, the state's fund.
3. EE, Language shared with: "Finnish is a close relative". The cited TildeOpen card is silent.
4. FI, AI Factory: "antennas in Iceland, Latvia and Switzerland". No cited page mentions antennas. This also conflicts with SE's "Switzerland's antenna attaches to it".
5. LV, Strategy: AI Centre founders given as "the environment, economics and defence ministries". The Saeima release names VARAM as the Ministry of Smart Administration and Regional Development.
6. LT, EuroHPC system: LitAI's machine "will be the first EuroHPC-co-funded machine on Lithuanian soil". The cited page does not say so.
7. LT, AI Factory: "timeline not stated". EuroHPC says the factories are "set to be deployed next year" (2026).
8. LT, Models: Neurotechnology's are "the first open Lithuanian LLMs". The page says "its first", meaning the company's first.
9. SE, Language shared with: "mutually intelligible with Danish and Norwegian". The cited pages are silent.
10. SE, AI Factory: "Switzerland's antenna attaches to it". No cited page says so.
11. SE, Models: Svea's second stage "includes fine-tuning open models and training some from scratch". The page presents this as what Sweden needs, not as Stage 2 work.

Also contradicted in Task B:
- LT: "EUR 90 million by the Commission platform". The Commission DSJ page says EUR 65 million (50% of EUR 130m).
- EE: the Gigafactory cell cites the LUMI about page, which does not mention it. The fact is in ERR (press).

## Review: France, Iberia, Italy and Malta (FR, IT, MT, PT, ES), 2026-10-10

Tools: WebSearch available yes; about 95 URLs fetched (WebFetch, plus curl/pdftotext for four PDFs and one bot-blocked page); 17 failed (403: enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr, info.gouv.fr, economie.gouv.fr, mdia.gov.mt, two gov.mt pages, nso.gov.mt; connection refused: idris.fr; 401/404: two Hugging Face iGenius URLs, an OSOR-style francophonie.org guess, eurydice, cplp.org id page, an ACL preview; empty: diariodarepublica.pt; JS-only: fedlex.admin.ch). Every non-press URL cited in the five snapshots was reachable. The press-only URLs (Presse-Citron, Fortune Italia, Corriere Comunicazioni, ECO, DPL News, Bolsamania) support only **[unverified]** items and were not fetched for Task A.

Method note: a claim is judged against the URLs cited **in its own row**. Where a row's own pages are silent but another URL cited elsewhere in the same entry supports the claim, it is marked CONFIRMED with "(other row's URL)".

#### NOT CONFIRMED claims
1. FR, Language shared with: "French official in Belgium and Luxembourg". The only cited URL (Italy's Law 482/1999) does not support it; the row needs a source.
2. FR, Models: "Lucie instruct release January 2025". Neither the HF card nor GENCI dates an instruct release.
3. FR, Language resources: ORTOLANG "CNRS-led". The site lists CNRS as one of eight partners and does not say it leads.
4. IT, Languages: population "provisional". Eurostat flags only FR as provisional.
5. IT, EuroHPC system: "LISA upgrade inaugurated June 2026". The cited pages name LISA with no date.
6. MT, Languages: population "provisional". Not flagged.
7. MT, Language shared with: "English with Ireland". The cited Maltese Constitution is silent on Ireland.
8. PT, Languages: population "provisional". Not flagged.
9. PT, Key institutions: "NOVA, IST, Coimbra, Porto and Minho (AMALIA)". None of the row's pages lists the consortium; the UMinho page names only UMinho and has IST as the venue.
10. ES, Languages: population "provisional". Not flagged. The ES and IT rows also do not cite Eurostat at all.
11. ES, AI Factory: "1HealthAI selected 10 October 2025". The cited 1HealthAI page gives no date.

## Review: sections 2, 4 and 6 (routes, EU vehicles, cross-cutting), 2026-10-10

Tools: WebSearch available yes; 86 URLs fetched (48 cited plus 38 for Task B and fallbacks); 9 failed (all 6 cited EUR-Lex URLs return an empty WAF challenge to both curl and WebFetch, retried once each; openeurollm.eu/news is 404; two Funding & Tenders JSON probes 404).

Method note: pages were fetched with curl and converted to text in the scratchpad, and quotes were matched by regex, so every quote below is verbatim from the page as served on 2026-10-10. The EUR-Lex texts were read from the same CELEX documents on the Publications Office (publications.europa.eu/resource/celex/<CELEX> and the cellar DOC_1 it resolves to), because eur-lex.europa.eu itself was unreachable. Those verdicts are marked "(via PO copy)". The cited URL should either be kept with that caveat or switched to the Publications Office URL.

Replace the 404 URL. | https://openeurollm.eu/blog/LUMI-Extreme-Scale-Access-2025 ; https://openeurollm.eu/blog/multisynt-synthetic-training-data ; https://www.openeurollm.eu/blog/strategic-access-EuroHPC-OpenEuroLLM | "awarded 1.5 million GPU hours ... through the Finnish LUMI Extreme Scale Access 2025 call" ; "granted strategic access across multiple EuroHPC centres, in the amount of over 10 million GPU hours" |
| OpenEuroLLM | Budget figure "only in press" | NOT FOUND (official) | No budget figure appears on openeurollm.eu (home, deliverables, launch post, first-year post) or on alt-edic.eu/projects/openeurollm. WebSearch found only press figures, which disagree with each other. Keep it [unverified]. | https://openeurollm.eu/blog/launch-press-release ; https://openeurollm.eu/blog/first-year-progress-and-next-steps | (no figure on page) |
| EUROPA | Other members, cash funding and delivery date | NOT FOUND (official) | The Commission page names only Domyn. The Domyn blog fetched (europe-role-ai-race) confirms the selection but names no partners and gives no date. A WebSearch summary named Fraunhofer and "second half of 2027", but those did not appear in the fetched page text, so they are not supplied. | https://www.domyn.com/blog/europe-role-ai-race | "On June 19, the European Commission selected the Domyn-led Europa consortium to build Europe's frontier AI model" |
| ALT-EDIC | Roster current; "Germany and Sweden appear on no fetched list" | FOUND (contradicts the note) | ALT-EDIC's own member page lists 17 member states plus Flanders as Members, and as Observers AT, BE, CY, EE, IS (Iceland), MT, PT, RO, **SE (Sweden, via Linköping University)** and SK. That is nine EU observers plus Iceland. Germany is absent. The sentence about Sweden is wrong; the observer count should be 9 EU states plus Iceland on this page. | https://alt-edic.eu/member-states/ | "Observers ... SE – Sweden \| Linköping University \| SK – Slovakia \| Ministry of Education" |
| Compute access | Whether the industrial AI Factory modes are free for public bodies | FOUND | The industrial modes are not for public bodies: they are open to industry only, free for SMEs and start-ups, and pay-per-use for others. Public authorities apply through the AI for Science and Collaborative EU Projects call, which is free. | https://www.eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/ai-factories/faqs-ai-factories_en ; https://www.eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/ai-factories/ai-factories-access-modes_en | "The AI Factories for Industrial Innovation call is open for applicants coming from industrial sector only." ; "Access time offered via the EUROHPC JU access calls is free of charge." |

### Section 2 (examples only)

#### A. Verification

| Where (subsection or table row) | Claim | Verdict | Evidence (quote ≤25 words, or what the page says) | URL |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1–R4 "European examples" | No route names a European example with a URL. R1 points to section 5. R2 names vehicles (an AI Factory's model programme, "the Commission's Large AI Grand Challenge consortium", OpenEuroLLM, EuroHPC-funded projects) without URLs. | n/a (nothing to check) | Observation, not a verdict: R2 says "Large AI Grand Challenge" but section 4 describes the Frontier AI Grand Challenge and EUROPA. Check that this name is intended. | (none) |

### Section 6

#### A. Verification

| Where (subsection or table row) | Claim | Verdict | Evidence (quote ≤25 words, or what the page says) | URL |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| All of section 6 | No claim in section 6 carries a URL (it is the author's reading, as the section says) | n/a (nothing to check) | Consistency observations against the section 4 sources: (1) the language-cluster table's "PIAST for Moldova's antenna" matches the antenna page ("linking ... to PIAST AI Factory in Poland"); (2) its "Serbia's ... antennas" under South Slavic with SLAIF: Serbia's antenna is linked to Pharos and IT4LIA, not SLAIF ("integrate ... with the EuroHPC Pharos AI Factory in Greece and IT4LIA AI Factory in Italy"), which the vehicle column partly reflects; (3) "NLAIF from 2028" has no source in section 4. | https://www.eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/eurohpc-ju-selects-ai-factory-antennas-broaden-ai-factories-initiative-2025-10-13_en |

#### B. Unverified claims

### Summary

| Section | Claims checked | Confirmed | Not confirmed | Unclear | Unverified | Found | Not found |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | 56 | 43 | 12 | 1 | 9 | 6 | 3 |
| 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

How to read the counts: the 43 confirmed include one fact confirmed on a different cited URL (the ALT-EDIC offer). The 12 NOT CONFIRMED in section 4 fall into two groups. Six are facts found on uncited official pages, so only the citation needs changing: the round dates, Bulgaria's tender, Greece's DAEDALUS, DAEDALUS and Arrhenius on the supercomputers page, CASPIr, and the AI Factory mode timings (the 2- and 4-working-day figures were not found anywhere). Six are wrong or overstated: "eleven states" (the page gives twelve), Romania's 1 Sept 2026 date, Sweden "online 2027", "EUR 10 bn to AI Factories", "buy European" as a quotation, and the 3 M Leonardo hours offered as evidence for continued pretraining. Seven section 4 verdicts rely on Publications Office copies, because the cited EUR-Lex URLs could not be fetched.
